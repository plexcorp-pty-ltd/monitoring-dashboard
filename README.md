# Monitoring dashboard

This project is built using PHP, and is designed to be a basic monitoring dashboard for Linux servers - similar to the "htop" command. Metrics are collected periodically every few minutes and posted to the dashboard.

The dashboard will then refresh every so often, providing a near real time health check for your servers. There is also an email alert facility to notify you of abnormal spikes.
